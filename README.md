# Procedural-Array-Map
Currently this is only a basic java program to create an array of variable length and width. Each spot in the array has its own rgb values that are generated procedually as to give a somewhat smooth heatmap.

As this is intended to be used with genetic algorithms each spot of the array also has a chance to contain "food" of a certain type, depending on what the dominant RGB value is in the area.
