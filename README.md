# Procedural-Array-Map
Currently this is only a basic java program to create an array of variable length and width. Each spot in the array has its own rgb values that are generated procedually as to give a somewhat smooth heatmap.

This program was written as a proof on concept and example for a discussion on implimenting soft boundaries for speciation in a genetic algorithm. Using the RGB values the agents would be given a bonus to certain actions and energy to simulate how adapted to an enviornment they are and to encorage agents to seek out areas that fit them best and reproduce with other agents of simmilar RGB values (ex. a polar bear should not be at home in a desert nor should a lizard be able to survive in the arctic).
